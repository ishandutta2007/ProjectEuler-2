#                                                                                                                       #
#       Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a special sum set if for            #
#       any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:                                 #
#                                                                                                                       #
#               i.  S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.                                              #
#               ii. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).                                                #
#       If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special sum set.                                #
#       The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.                                                        #
#                                                                                                                       #
#               n = 1: {1}                                                                                              #
#               n = 2: {1, 2}                                                                                           #
#               n = 3: {2, 3, 4}                                                                                        #
#               n = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}                                                                                     #
#               n = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}                                                                               #
#                                                                                                                       #
#       It seems that for a given optimum set, A = {a1, a2, ... , an}, the next optimum set is of the form              #
#       B = {b, a1+b, a2+b, ... ,an+b}, where b is the "middle" element on the previous row.                            #
#                                                                                                                       #
#       By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for n = 6 to be A = {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24},           #
#       with S(A) = 117. However, this is not the optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a      #
#       near optimum set. The optimum set for n = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25}, with S(A) = 115 and                #
#       corresponding set string: 111819202225.                                                                         #
#                                                                                                                       #
#       Given that A is an optimum special sum set for n = 7, find its set string.                                      #
#                                                                                                                       #
#       NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 105 and Problem 106.                                                   #
