#       If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random,      #
#       it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.                                            #                                                                                      #

#       The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random,                                    #
#       is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.                                                                   #

#       By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total,                                              #
#       determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.                                                                          #
