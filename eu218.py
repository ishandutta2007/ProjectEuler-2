#       Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25. The area of this triangle is 84,                                      #
#       which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.                                                                                     #
#       Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.                                                          #
#       Also c is a perfect square.                                                                                                             #
