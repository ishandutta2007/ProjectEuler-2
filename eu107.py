#       However, it is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges and still ensure that all points         #
#       on the network remain connected. The network which achieves the maximum saving is shown below.                  #
#       It has a weight of 93, representing a saving of 243 âˆ’ 93 = 150 from the original network.                       #
#                                                                                                                       #
#       Using network.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 6K text file containing a network with          #
#       forty vertices, and given in matrix form, find the maximum saving which can be achieved by removing             #
#       redundant edges whilst ensuring that the network remains connected.                                             #
