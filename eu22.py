#       Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand       #
#       first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,#
#       multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.                            #
#                                                                                                                       #
#       For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53,  #
#       is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.                              #
#                                                                                                                       #
#       What is the total of all the name scores in the file?                                                           #
