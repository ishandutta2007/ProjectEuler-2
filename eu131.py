#                                                                                                                                               #
#       There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube.      #
#                                                                                                                                               #
#       For example, when p = 19, 83 + 82Ã—19 = 123.                                                                                             #
#                                                                                                                                               #
#       What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of n is unique,                                     #
#       and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.                                                                                  #
#                                                                                                                                               #
#       How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?                                                                        #
